This repository demonstrates an uncommon Python bug involving unexpected TypeErrors when dividing by zero or non-numeric types. The initial code handles ZeroDivisionError gracefully, but the handling of TypeErrors is limited, leading to unexpected behavior for string inputs. The solution enhances the error handling to specifically address TypeErrors arising from string inputs, thus improving the robustness of the function.
